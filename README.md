# Hey there! 🌷

I’m **Plaksha Sharma** ;) not perfect, just *passionately focused*.  
✨ Exploring, learning & experimenting my way through **code, design, and discovery**.  

If I dream it 💭, I’ll build it ⚙️, break it 🧩, and rebuild it better.  

My world spins around:
- 🧠 **Learning** new stacks & systems  
- 💻 **Building** ideas into reality  
- 🌍 **Exploring** anything that catches my attention  

When I set a goal, I *don’t stop* - I find a way.  
> “Stay curious, stay unfinished - that’s where the magic lives.” ✨
